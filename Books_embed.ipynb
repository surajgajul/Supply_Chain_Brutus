Both theoretical and applied books are included. It describes current advances anywhere in the world that are at the cutting edge of the ﬁeld. The series is aimed especially at researchers, advanced graduate students, and sophisticated practitioners. The series features three types of books: • Advanced expository books', 'sophisticated practitioners. The series features three types of books: • Advanced expository books that extend and unify our understanding of particular areas. • Research monographs that make substantial contributions to knowledge. • Handbooks that deﬁne the new state of the art in particular areas. Each handbook will be edited by a leading authority in the area who will organize a team of experts on various aspects of the topic to write individual chapters. A handbook may emphasize expository surveys or completely new advances (either research or applications) or a combination of both. The series emphasizes the following four areas: Mathematical Programming: Including linear programming, integer program- ming, nonlinear programming, interior point methods, game theory, network opti-', 'integer program- ming, nonlinear programming, interior point methods, game theory, network opti- mization models, combinatorics, equilibrium programming, complementarity the- ory, multiobjective optimization, dynamic programming, stochastic programming, complexity theory, etc. Applied Probability: Including queuing theory, simulation, renewal theory, Brownian motion and diffusion processes, decision analysis, Markov decision processes, reliability theory, forecasting, other stochastic processes motivated by applications, etc. Production and Operations Management: Including inventory theory, pro- duction scheduling, capacity planning, facility location, supply chain management, distribution systems, materials requirements planning, just-in-time systems, ﬂexible manufacturing systems,', 'systems, materials requirements planning, just-in-time systems, ﬂexible manufacturing systems, design of production lines, logistical planning, strategic issues, etc. Applications of Operations Research and Management Science: Including telecommunications, health care, capital budgeting and ﬁnance, economics, mar- keting, public policy, military operations research, humanitarian relief and disaster mitigation, service operations, transportation systems, etc. This book series is indexed in Scopus.

Preface Purpose and Content of the Book This handbook comprises recent developments in a new research ﬁeld of the ripple effects in supply chains (SC). Building upon success of the 1st edition of this handbook', 'the ripple effects in supply chains (SC). Building upon success of the 1st edition of this handbook published in 2019, we developed this 2nd edition. A lot has changed in our lives and SCs since 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world. SCs have been exposed to hyper shocks, which have widely destabilized demand, supply, and logistics. Ripple effects have been rolling through SC networks at the unprecedented scale unlike any seen before. The semiconductor and container crises along with increasing geopolitical tensions (e.g., global and reciprocal tariffs in March- April 2025) came on top of the pandemic, making the ripple effect and SC stress testing important topics in SC and operations management. At the same time, rapid developments in digital technologies and artiﬁcial', 'operations management. At the same time, rapid developments in digital technologies and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) made SCs adapt not only to negative but also to positive, technological disruptions. In this setting, it is not surprisingly that the interest in the ripple effect has been exponentially growing. New theories such as SC viability, intertwined supply networks, and reconﬁgurable SC have been developed. The ripple effect analysis using digital twins became a topic of a growing interest. AI applications to managing SC resilience and ripple effect provide new interesting research contributions. The 2nd edition of the handbook addresses both novel developments encoun- tered in 2019–2024, adding several new chapters, and presents the fundamental knowledge about the ripple effect']\n"

      "The ripple effect in the supply chain refers to the phenomenon where a disruption at one point in the supply chain propagates throughout the entire network, impacting overall supply chain performance. This effect can lead to issues such as decreased sales, missed on-time deliveries, reduced total profit, and even long-term consequences like market share losses. The ripple effect is triggered by high-impact, low-frequency events (e.g., natural disasters, plant explosions) that cannot be localized and thus cascade downstream, causing missing materials, production decreases, and further disruptions at subsequent stages. It is also known as the “domino effect” or “snowball effect.” The ripple effect is distinct from the bullwhip effect, as it involves structural disruptions and exceptional risks rather than operational fluctuations. Preventing or mitigating the ripple effect requires proactive redundancy, flexibility, and significant coordination efforts for both short-term stabilization and long-term recovery.\n"
