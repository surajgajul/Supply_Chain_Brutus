The jsonl file is a high-quality Q&A dataset constructed using a Reverse-RAG pipeline. We leveraged multiple LLM models (gpt 4.1, kimi-k2, claude sonnet 4, grok-4) and embedding models (large/small-3, titan) for this effort.

The db file is a demo milvus file with a single ebook pushed as a trial run (the actual file is quite large).

The jupyter notebooks contain the code for generating questions and their respective answers using our pipeline.
